*   Calculate the total number of votes cast.
    
*   By County:
    *   Get a list of counties in the vote.
    *   Calculate the percentage of votes for each county.

## Summary
DAI was successful in providing accurate and timely election results to the Colorado Board of Elections.  The election results were tallied based on DAI's development of a Python coding script by DAI's staff of experienced coders.  DAI worked with the Colorado Board of Elections to develop the script to accomplish their needs.  And, DAI wrote the script so that it could easily be applied to other similar elections.  In today's world voter integrity is a necessity.  DAI is offering to present this script to other election boards for implmentation.

DAI can meet with other election boards so that the script fully meets their needs.  The script would require very few changes.  Specifically the changes would inlcude: 1) data file - Each election board would have their own raw data file with the individual votes to provide; 2) reading the raw file - Each board may have different formats to their raw data and some small changes may be needed so that the data is read from this file correctly.  

DAI is proposing a meeting with the election committee to allow for presentations of this program to other election boards.
